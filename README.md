A new Flutter project.   
Using this project I have learned a bit of UI and Flutter State Management using Bloc pattern.

I am doing this project as a starting point of flutter and to understand the basics of the framework.

This is project is a simple app that generates random word pairs which you can save and see your saved words as long as the app is running. If you close the app the saved words should disappear.


## Installation
```bash
flutter pub get
```
